Hello! I’m Sebastian Piaścik. Freelance designer specializing in front-end development. I'm a secound year student at University of Gdańsk studying Informatics. Currently i am working in Arango. My responsibilities in this interactive agency include the creation of web pages based on pre-prepared templates and online shops using twig and symfony.

I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn.

Currently developing skills with app development. Feel free to contact me :)
